## Tank Utility Driver
This driver retrieves and saves values from Tank Utility API every 3 hours.  This device driver includes a tile attribute that can be used by the attribute template in the dashboards.  The tile has a div that is assigned to norm, warn, alarm which allows for some CSS formating in the dashboards to give color to the tile.  Battery status will show up in the upper left corner if the status for the battery is not "ok".  This statusis based off of the battery_warn and battery_crit flags from the API. Finally, the lastreading
date will appear under the reading if the last reading is over 2 days old, indicating a stale reading.
